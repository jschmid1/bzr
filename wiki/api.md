# API

- Language:

    Python Flask

- Concept:
    
    Main entry-point for all clients and generators
    
    Validations should happen here to avoid adding constraints ( e.g what goods can be produced out of which BasicGoods ) to every client.

    Providing an overview of what is possible should also reside here.
    
- Lerning:
    
    Use Generators - Coroutines - Decorators to become familiar with that    
    
    Use some design pattern that fits
